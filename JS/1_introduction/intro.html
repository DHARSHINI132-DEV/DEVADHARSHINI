javascript can be used in both frontend and in backend
javascript can be written in 2 ways 
    1.internal ->   written inside html file.
                    internal javascript should be written inside body tag before closing the body tag
    2.external ->   write in new file and connect the html and js file
                    to connect,use script tag,in src give the path to that file  <script src="./intro.js"></script>

👍clg or log  shortcut key -> console.log() -> used to print the statement

==>👍in javascript semicolon is not mandatory .if given also it will not show error

❗❗⚡important question -> difference between let,var,const⚡❗❗
for declaring a variable we have 3 keywords  in javascript
1.let =>    possible => declaration is possible,initialization is possible,reinitialization
            not possible=> ❗❗re-declaration not possible.
2.var =>  possible=>we can reinitialize the value.
                    ❗❗re-declaration  possible.
3.const => it can't be changed later
            possible=> declaration and initialization should be in the same line
            not possible=>declaration,initialization,re-initialization


❗❗typeof❗❗ operator

typeof operator  is used to know the datatype of the variable
console.log(typeof eid)


datatype:
    1.primitive
        ->number 
            => number is integer ,float the  datatype will be number  
        ->String 
            => for initialization of String ,use double quote "",single quote '',batig `` also
        ->boolean 
            => true or false
        ->undefined 
            => if variable id declared and not initialized then it will show as undefined.
            => typeof undefined is also undefined.
