javascript can be used in both frontend and in backend
javascript can be written in 2 ways 
    1.internal -->  written inside html file.
                    internal javascript should be written inside body tag before closing the body tag
    2.external -->  write in new file and connect the html and js file
                    to connect --> use script tag,in src give the path to that file  <script src="./intro.js"></script>

clg or log --> console.log() -> used to print the statement

==>in javascript no need to give semicolon at the end of end statement it is not neccessasy .if given also it will not show error

❗❗⚡important question -> difference between let,var,const⚡❗❗
❗❗⚡difference between null ,undefined⚡❗❗
for declaring a variable we have 3 keywords  in javascript
1.let =>    possible => declaration is possible,initialization is possible, reinitialize the value.
            not possible=> ❗❗re-declaration not possible.
2.var =>  possible=>we can reinitialize the value.
                    ❗❗re-declaration  possible.
3.const => it can't be changed later
            possible=> declaration and initialization should be in the same line
            not possible=>declaration,initialization,re-initialization


❗❗typeof❗❗

typeof operator  is used to know the datatype of the variable
console.log(typeof eid)


datatype:
    1.primitive
        ->number 
            => number is integer ,float the  datatype will be number  
        ->String 
            => for initialization of String ,use double quote "",single quote '',batig `` also
        ->boolean 
            =>true or false
        ->undefined 
            => if variable id declared and not initialized then it will show as undefined
        ->null 
            => no value.currently don't know the value but later on it will be initialized means give null.typeof null is object
        ->bigint
            =>

    2.non primitive datatype
        ->Array
            =>it is linear datastructure and we can store multiple values(we can give both homogeneous and heterogeneous values)
            syntax- let arr[10,20,"san"]
        ->function
            syntax-function display()
            {

            }
            display()
        ->object
            syntax-let student{
                sname:"rohit",
                age:20,
                address:"chennai"
            }
